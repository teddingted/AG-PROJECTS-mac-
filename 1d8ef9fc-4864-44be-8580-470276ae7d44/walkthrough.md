# Fitness Tracker App Walkthrough

I have built a personal fitness tracker that runs entirely in your browser. It's designed to be fast, aesthetic, and private.

## Features

## Native Mac App (New!)
You asked for it, we built it. `FitTrack` is now available as a standalone Mac application.

### How to Run
1.  Navigate to `/Users/dm_chamber/.gemini/antigravity/scratch`
2.  Double-click **FitTrack.app**.
3.  Enjoy the native experience with a dedicated window!

*(Note: Since this is a locally built app, if macOS warns you about an "Unidentified Developer", simply Right-Click the app > Open > Open).*

## Features
### 1. Dashboard
Your command center. Check your stats, see recent activity, and get motivated by the cyberpunk design.

### 2. "SMASH IT" Recorder
*   **Punch Grid**: Select exercises instantly from the neon grid.
*   **Custom Drills**: Scroll down and hit "CUSTOM" to add your own exercises (Cardio, Weights, or Reps).
*   **Smart Inputs**: The app automatically asks for Time, Distance, or Weight based on the exercise.
*   **Pro FX**: Feel the **screen shake** and hear the **cyber-success sound** when you log a workout.

### 3. History & Editing
*   **Track Progress**: See your history with improved readability.
*   **Edit/Delete**: Made a mistake? Just hit the trash icon to remove an entry.

## How to Use

1.  Navigate to the project folder: `/Users/dm_chamber/.gemini/antigravity/scratch`
2.  Double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
3.  Start tracking!

## Technical Details
*   **Stack**: HTML5, Vanilla CSS, Vanilla JavaScript.
*   **Storage**: Uses `localStorage` so your data persists even if you close the browser.
*   **Offline Capable**: Works without internet.
*   **Responsive**: Optimized for mobile and desktop.
