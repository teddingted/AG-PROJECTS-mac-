## Final LinkedIn Strategy Notes

### From Naver Blog: Top 1% LinkedIn Usage Strategy
1. **Continuous Resume Management**: Don't wait until you're looking for a job. Keep your profile updated with achievements to maintain quality. MDs, marketers, and planners should also consider a Notion portfolio.
2. **Industry Research**: Use LinkedIn to identify key players, role models, and HR managers. Research interviewers' careers and interests beforehand.
3. **Direct Networking**: Don't hesitate to DM practitioners at global companies or startups. Introduce yourself properly and be respectful.
4. **Global Opportunities**: Aim for 300-500 connections initially to start receiving headhunter offers. The author has 16k connections.
5. **Connection Count**: The number of connections affects visibility (1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree). High connection count = higher search visibility.
6. **Professional Profile Picture**: A professional bust-up photo is essential. Avoid generic passport/ID photos.
7. **Opportunity Platform**: LinkedIn can create major career opportunities, such as country manager roles.
8. **Utilize Groups**: Join or create groups based on interests to build a community and generate value.
9. **Strategic Connections**: Connect with multinational incumbents, HR, headhunters, and peers.
10. **Content Strategy**: Share articles -> add opinions -> create original content for personal branding.

### From YouTube: LinkedIn for Career Management (Director Minhee Choi)
- **First Steps**: Upload a profile photo and update current workplace for trust.
- **Storytelling**: Use a "story" in your profile to be more memorable.
- **Micro-Consistency**: Everyone starts from zero. Focus on building your record over several years.
- **Career Transitions**: Posting about leaving a job with passion can attract new offers.
- **Value-Driven Branding**: Focus on providing clear value to your audience.
