# Archive Cleanup Task

- [x] List contents of the `archive` folder on the Desktop
- [x] Compare `archive` contents against `AG-PROJECTS-mac-` repository
  - *Result*: The `archive` folder contains the **actual source code** (e.g., `AutoPlotDigitizerWeb`). It is **NOT** backed up in Git or GitHub yet.
- [x] Ensure any missing projects/files are migrated to `AG-PROJECTS-mac-` (User confirmed option 1)
- [x] Delete files in `archive` that are safely backed up in Git/GitHub
